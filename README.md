# Vision-based-control-of-twolink-robotic-arm
Developed a control system whose feedback is through the vision sensor i.e camera. 

in this project we used homography concept to get actual position in x,y only from the
image which is already calibrated before the project.

getColor.m this is the function to extract different color objects from the image.
vision_worksheet.png is the colored image for calibrating the image cordinates to the real world cordinates.

twolinkDynamics_vision_worksheet.slx is the SIMULINK file where robotic arm is control through vision system.
